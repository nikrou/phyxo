The <info>%command.name%</info> command installs all themes web assets into a given
directory (e.g. the <comment>public</comment> directory).

  <info>php %command.full_name% public</info>

A "themes" directory will be created inside the target directory and the
"build" directory of each theme will be copied into it.

You can install assets for a theme by usign <comment>theme</comment> argument.
By default installation applies for all themes

To create a symlink to each theme instead of copying its assets, use the
<info>--symlink</info> option (will fall back to hard copies when symbolic links aren't possible:

  <info>php %command.full_name% public --symlink</info>

To make symlink relative, add the <info>--relative</info> option:

  <info>php %command.full_name% public --symlink --relative</info>
